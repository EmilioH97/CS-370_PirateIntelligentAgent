What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are tasked with using code to create a software to solve many different possible problems. This is important to fix problems and create better user experiences for all kinds of different software.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When faced witha problem I like to go back and break the problem up into smaller steps.
